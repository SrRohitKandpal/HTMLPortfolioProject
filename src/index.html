        <h3>What I do?</h3>
        <p>I'm actually doing coding from last 1.5 years but that was only Web Designing. Four months before I got to know about codeschool, so I jumped in, I signed up as a paid customer and completed almost all the courses of HTML/CSS path except <em>SASS</em> and <em>Blasting Off with Bootstrap</em>. I can make user flow diagrams, personas, Information Architecture and planned a whole web project. I'm also well aware of Bootstrap as I'm doing it from sometime. Technologies I have used yet are HTML,CSS and JS(little bit), JQuery.</p>
        
        <p>But as I'm moving ahead in professional life, I'm so much excited to learn JS especially functional programming, OOP's, MV Frameworks like <strong>AngularJs</strong>, <strong>ReactJs</strong>, <strong>BackboneJs</strong> and the whole JS programming. I just hope that I'm going to cover all these things till the end of the year. I'm not only follwing paths just of codeschool but also of developer.mozilla, freeCodeCamp and also developes.google. Hope for a great #DevYear2017. </p>
